Analysis of the financial record of a company 


In this challenge, I am  using the concepts I've learned about iterating arrays, concatenation and using conditional statements. This activity presents a real-world situation where I was given a task to analyzr the financial records of a company. 

The task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
